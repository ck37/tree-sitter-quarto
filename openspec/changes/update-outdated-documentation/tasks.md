# Implementation Tasks

## 1. Documentation Audit

- [ ] 1.1 Read through all files in docs/ directory
- [ ] 1.2 Note current test count mentions (should be 145/145)
- [ ] 1.3 Note current requirement count mentions (should be 116/116)
- [ ] 1.4 Note current spec count mentions (should be 9)
- [ ] 1.5 Note any "planned" or "pending" features that are now complete
- [ ] 1.6 Create detailed checklist of changes needed per file

## 2. Search for Outdated Metrics

- [ ] 2.1 Grep for old test counts and list occurrences:
  - [ ] `grep -r "58.*test" docs/`
  - [ ] `grep -r "122.*test" docs/`
  - [ ] `grep -r "42.*test" docs/`
- [ ] 2.2 Grep for old requirement counts:
  - [ ] `grep -r "62.*requirement" docs/`
  - [ ] `grep -r "63.*requirement" docs/`
  - [ ] `grep -r "98%" docs/`
- [ ] 2.3 Grep for status markers to verify:
  - [ ] `grep -r "pending\|planned\|TODO" docs/`

## 3. Update docs/todo.md

- [ ] 3.1 Update header progress: 100% (116/116 requirements, 145/145 tests)
- [ ] 3.2 Mark all completed sections with ✅
- [ ] 3.3 Update "Last Updated" date
- [ ] 3.4 Remove or archive completed TODO items
- [ ] 3.5 Add note about current project status (production-ready)

## 4. Update docs/implementation-status.md

- [ ] 4.1 Review each feature section
- [ ] 4.2 Update status from "planned" to "implemented" where applicable
- [ ] 4.3 Update test counts for each feature
- [ ] 4.4 Mark all implemented features with ✅
- [ ] 4.5 Update overall progress metrics

## 5. Update docs/plan.md

- [ ] 5.1 Mark completed implementation phases
- [ ] 5.2 Update timeline with actual completion dates
- [ ] 5.3 Update "Current Status" section
- [ ] 5.4 Note any remaining work (if any) or mark as complete
- [ ] 5.5 Update roadmap for next steps (WASM, validation, etc.)

## 6. Review Other Documentation Files

- [ ] 6.1 Review docs/comparison.md - ensure accurate
- [ ] 6.2 Review docs/editor-integration.md - update status
- [ ] 6.3 Review docs/quarto-web-test-results.md - add note about age
- [ ] 6.4 Review docs/reference-documentation.md - ensure current
- [ ] 6.5 Review any other docs files for outdated content

## 7. Consistency Check

- [ ] 7.1 Ensure all docs use "145/145 tests" consistently
- [ ] 7.2 Ensure all docs use "116/116 requirements" consistently
- [ ] 7.3 Ensure all docs use "9 specifications" consistently
- [ ] 7.4 Ensure status markers (✅ ⏳ ⚠️) are consistent across files
- [ ] 7.5 Ensure terminology is consistent (alpha complete, production-ready, etc.)

## 8. Final Verification

- [ ] 8.1 Re-run greps to confirm old metrics are gone:
  - [ ] `grep -r "58.*test\|122.*test\|42.*test" docs/` (should be empty)
  - [ ] `grep -r "62.*requirement\|63.*requirement\|98%" docs/` (should be empty)
- [ ] 8.2 Verify all files have been reviewed
- [ ] 8.3 Check for any remaining TODOs in completed areas
- [ ] 8.4 Ensure documentation reflects current reality

## 9. Update Documentation Date Stamps

- [ ] 9.1 Update "Last Updated" dates in affected files
- [ ] 9.2 Add update notes where significant changes made
- [ ] 9.3 Consider adding version or date to file headers

## Notes

- This is documentation-only, no code changes
- Focus on accuracy and consistency
- Remove aspirational language ("will", "planned") for completed work
- Use confident language ("is", "does", "supports") for current state
