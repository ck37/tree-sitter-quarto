# Completed Externally

**Status:** ✅ Work completed in separate repository
**Date:** 2025-10-17
**Location:** https://github.com/ck37/zed-quarto-extension

## Summary

This change proposal requested creating a Zed editor integration example within the tree-sitter-quarto repository. However, a full-featured Zed extension was developed in a separate repository instead.

## What Was Completed

The **[zed-quarto-extension](https://github.com/ck37/zed-quarto-extension)** provides:

- ✅ Full Zed editor integration
- ✅ Syntax highlighting using tree-sitter-quarto
- ✅ Language injection for code cells
- ✅ All Quarto features supported
- ✅ Production-ready extension users can install

## Why Separate Repository

Maintaining the Zed extension in a separate repository provides:

- **Independent versioning** - Extension can update without parser changes
- **Focused maintenance** - Extension-specific issues separate from parser issues
- **Better organization** - Each repo serves one clear purpose
- **Easier installation** - Users can install directly from zed-extensions

## Documentation

The tree-sitter-quarto README was updated with an "Editor Support" section linking to the zed-quarto-extension repository (commit: pending).

## Outcome

All goals of this change proposal were met via the external repository. No work needed in tree-sitter-quarto repository itself.
