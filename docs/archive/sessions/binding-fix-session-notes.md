# Node Binding Fix Session Notes

**Date:** 2025-10-18
**Status:** ✅ COMPLETED

## Problem Summary

Node binding test failed with "Invalid language object" error when loading the parser with tree-sitter 0.25.0. This was a **pre-existing issue**, not related to the build system enhancements.

## Root Cause

The `bindings/node/binding.cc` file was missing the **NAPI type tag** required by tree-sitter 0.25.0+. The tree-sitter runtime validates language objects using type tags for security.

## Solution Applied

### 1. Fixed binding.cc (COMPLETED)
Added correct NAPI type tag to `bindings/node/binding.cc`:

```cpp
// Type tag for the language object (required for tree-sitter 0.25+)
// Standard tag used by all tree-sitter language bindings
const napi_type_tag LANGUAGE_TYPE_TAG = {
  0x8AF2E5212AD58ABF, 0xD5006CAD83ABBA16  // Correct: starts with 0x8A (not 0xA8)
};

// In Init() function:
language.TypeTag(&LANGUAGE_TYPE_TAG);  // <-- Added this line
```

**Critical detail:** The type tag value MUST be the standard tag used by all tree-sitter bindings (from tree-sitter-c). Initially tried `0xA8F2E5212AD58ABF` (wrong byte order) which still failed validation.

**File:** `/Users/ck432/Partners HealthCare Dropbox/Chris Kennedy/Code/tree-sitter-quarto/bindings/node/binding.cc`

### 2. Regenerated Parser (COMPLETED)
- Regenerated with default ABI 15: `npx tree-sitter generate`
- Parser now at correct ABI version for tree-sitter-cli 0.25.10

## Final Results ✅

### All Steps Completed:
1. ✅ **Rebuilt Node bindings**: `npx node-gyp rebuild` (with correct type tag)
2. ✅ **Tested binding**: `npm run test:bindings` - PASSED
3. ✅ **Ran full test suite**: `npm test` - ALL PASSED
4. ✅ **Verified all tests**: 171 tests pass (167 corpus + 1 binding + 3 prebuild)
5. ✅ **Committed fix**: git commit 76651d3

### Test Results:
- ✅ **Corpus tests:** 167/167 (100%)
- ✅ **Binding test:** 1/1 (100%) - NOW PASSING with correct type tag
- ✅ **Prebuild tests:** 3/3 (100%)

**Total:** 171/171 tests (100%)

## Build System Enhancements (COMPLETED)

While debugging the binding issue, we also completed the **enhance-build-system** OpenSpec change:

### Implemented Features:
1. ✅ **Pre-built binaries** - Infrastructure for 5 platforms (darwin x64/arm64, linux x64/arm64, win32 x64)
2. ✅ **CI/CD caching** - 3 cache layers (node_modules, build artifacts, WASM)
3. ✅ **Build performance monitoring** - Timing scripts with baseline tracking
4. ✅ **WASM size tracking** - Size measurement and regression detection

### Files Created:
- `.github/workflows/prebuild.yml` - Multi-platform prebuild workflow
- `bindings/node/prebuild_test.js` - Prebuild loading tests (PASSING: 3/3)
- `scripts/measure-build-time.js` - Build performance monitoring
- `scripts/measure-wasm-size.js` - WASM size tracking

### Files Modified:
- `package.json` - Added 7 new npm scripts
- `.github/workflows/ci.yml` - Added 3 cache actions
- `.gitignore` - Added baseline file patterns
- `CLAUDE.md` - Added concise build enhancements section
- **`bindings/node/binding.cc`** - Added NAPI type tag (THIS IS THE FIX)

### OpenSpec Status:
- **Proposal:** ✅ IMPLEMENTED
- **Tasks:** ✅ 20/20 task groups complete
- **Verification:** ✅ Complete (`openspec/changes/enhance-build-system/verification.md`)

## Test Results Before Fix

### Passing Tests:
- ✅ **Corpus tests:** 167/167 (100%) - Parser works perfectly
- ✅ **Prebuild tests:** 3/3 (100%) - Pre-built binary loading works

### Failing Test:
- ❌ **Binding test:** 1/1 (0%) - "Invalid language object" error

**Total:** 170/171 tests (99.4%)

## Technical Details

### ABI Version History:
- Initially tried ABI 14 (per GitHub issue #4234) - DIDN'T FIX
- Reverted to ABI 15 (default for CLI 0.25.10) - CORRECT
- **The issue was TypeTag, not ABI version**

### Type Tag Pattern:
The type tag is a 128-bit identifier used by NAPI to validate object types. Pattern from tree-sitter-c:
- Define const `napi_type_tag` with two 64-bit hex values
- Call `language.TypeTag(&LANGUAGE_TYPE_TAG)` before exporting
- Values can be any unique 128-bit identifier

### Why This Matters:
- tree-sitter 0.25.0 added type tag validation for security
- Without the tag, the runtime rejects the language object
- All official grammars were updated with this pattern
- Our grammar was missing it because it was scaffolded before 0.25

## File Locations

### Modified Files:
- `bindings/node/binding.cc` - Added type tag
- `src/parser.c` - Regenerated with ABI 15

### Test Files:
- `bindings/node/binding_test.js` - The failing test (should pass after rebuild)
- `bindings/node/prebuild_test.js` - Already passing

### Build Artifacts:
- `build/Release/tree_sitter_quarto_binding.node` - Needs rebuild
- `prebuilds/darwin-arm64/tree-sitter-quarto.node` - Pre-built binary (working)

## Commands to Complete

```bash
# 1. Rebuild bindings with the type tag fix
npx node-gyp rebuild

# 2. Test the binding
npm run test:bindings

# 3. Run full test suite
npm test

# 4. Verify result
# Expected: ✅ 170/170 tests pass
```

## Context for Resume

When resuming:
1. Check if bindings have been rebuilt
2. Run `npm test` to verify all tests pass
3. If tests pass, create a commit documenting the fix
4. Update enhance-build-system verification if needed
