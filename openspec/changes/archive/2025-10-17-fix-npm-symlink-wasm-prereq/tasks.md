# Implementation Tasks

## 1. Fix npm Symlink Conflict

- [x] 1.1 Run `brew link --overwrite node` to resolve symlink conflict
  - Used `brew unlink node && brew link node` to recreate all 63 symlinks
- [x] 1.2 Verify no errors from symlink resolution
  - Symlinks recreated successfully
- [x] 1.3 Complete emscripten installation: `brew install emscripten`
  - Emscripten 4.0.16 already installed after symlink fix
- [x] 1.4 Verify emscripten installed: `emcc --version`
  - Confirmed: emcc 4.0.16-git

## 2. Verification

- [x] 2.1 Confirm emscripten version is 4.0.16 or compatible
  - Version 4.0.16-git confirmed
- [x] 2.2 Test basic emcc compilation (hello world)
  - Created test.c, compiled to WASM, ran with node - success
- [x] 2.3 Verify all emscripten tools available (emcc, em++, emrun)
  - All tools available at /opt/homebrew/bin/

## 3. Documentation

- [x] 3.1 Document npm symlink resolution in CONTRIBUTING.md or setup guide
  - Created docs/wasm-setup.md with full setup instructions
- [x] 3.2 Add emscripten version requirements to documentation
  - Documented: emscripten 4.0.16+, Node.js 24.10.0+
- [x] 3.3 Note macOS-specific setup steps (if applicable)
  - Documented macOS Homebrew installation and symlink conflict resolution
- [x] 3.4 Document verification steps for WASM toolchain
  - Included verification commands and test compilation example

## 4. Cleanup

- [x] 4.1 Check for any other homebrew conflicts
  - No other conflicts found
- [x] 4.2 Document resolution in project notes
  - Full resolution documented in docs/wasm-setup.md with troubleshooting
