## Dependencies

**Task 1.3 depends on 1.1-1.2** - Need pre-built binaries to test loading
**Task 2.4 depends on 2.1-2.3** - Document after implementing all caching
**Task 3.3 depends on 3.1-3.2** - Need monitoring script before CI integration
**Task 4.3 depends on 4.1-4.2** - Need size measurement before CI integration
**Task 5.1 depends on all phases** - Document after implementation complete

## Parallelizable Work

- **Phases 1 and 2 can run in parallel** - Pre-built binaries and caching are independent
- **Phases 3 and 4 can run in parallel** - Monitoring and WASM optimization are independent
- **Phase 5 must run after all others** - Documentation comes last

## Verification Criteria

Each task should be verified by:
1. **Functionality** - Feature works as specified
2. **Testing** - Automated tests pass
3. **CI Integration** - Works in CI/CD pipeline
4. **Documentation** - Changes documented in CLAUDE.md

**Change is complete when:**
- ✅ All tasks are checked off (20/20 task groups complete)
- ✅ Pre-built binaries infrastructure ready for 5 platforms
- ✅ CI build caching implemented (expected 30-50% reduction)
- ✅ Build performance monitoring scripts functional
- ✅ WASM size tracking scripts functional
- ✅ All documentation updated in CLAUDE.md
- ✅ verification.md created and marked IMPLEMENTED
