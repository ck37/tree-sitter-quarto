# Update Outdated Documentation

## Why

The project has evolved significantly since initial documentation was written:
- ✅ **100% spec coverage** (was 98%)
- ✅ **145/145 tests passing** (was 122/122, then various outdated counts)
- ✅ **All features implemented** (was alpha with pending features)
- ✅ **9 specifications** (was 8, then various counts)

**Outdated documentation found:**
1. **docs/todo.md** - Shows 98% (62/63 requirements), 58/58 tests
2. **docs/implementation-status.md** - Likely outdated with old metrics
3. **docs/plan.md** - May reference pending work that's now complete
4. Various docs may reference "planned" features that are now implemented

**Impact of outdated docs:**
- New contributors get confused about project status
- Users unsure if features are actually ready
- Undermines confidence in project quality
- Makes it harder to track actual progress
- Potential users may think parser is less complete than it is

**Why this matters:**
The parser is production-ready but documentation doesn't reflect this. Clean, accurate documentation is essential for:
- User adoption and confidence
- Contributor onboarding
- Maintainability
- Professional project image

## What Changes

### 1. Audit All Documentation
- Review all files in docs/ directory
- Identify specific outdated content (test counts, requirement counts, status labels)
- Create checklist of updates needed per file

### 2. Update Metrics Across Documentation
- **Test count**: Update to 145/145 passing (100%)
- **Requirement count**: Update to 116/116 (100%)
- **Spec count**: Update to 9 specifications
- **Status**: Update from "planned" to "implemented" where applicable
- **Success criteria**: Mark completed items as ✅

### 3. File-by-File Updates
- **docs/todo.md**: Update progress to 100%, mark all items complete
- **docs/implementation-status.md**: Update status for all features
- **docs/plan.md**: Mark completed phases, update roadmap
- **Any other docs**: Search for outdated metrics and update

### 4. Consistency Check
- Ensure all docs use consistent terminology
- Ensure all metrics match across files
- Verify status markers (✅ ⏳ ⚠️) are accurate

### 5. Verification
- Grep for old test counts (58, 122) and update
- Grep for old requirement counts (62, 63) and update
- Grep for "pending", "planned", "TODO" in completed areas
- Final consistency check across all docs

**No code changes** - Documentation only
